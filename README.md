# Clustering-Analysis-for-Complex-Networks
Implemented **Markov Clustering Algorithm** on 3 different data-sets to partition into subsets 
(clusters) which share some common features and can be grouped in the specific context of complex networks.
##Data-sets
   1) AT & T Web Network
   2) Physics Collaboration Network
   3) Yeast Metabolic Network
